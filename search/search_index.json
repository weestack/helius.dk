This is the earliest stage at which we can discover a new token, but it\u2019s also the most unstable. We might attempt to swap against a token that never actually exists due to issues like an incorrectly filled smart contract, a missing Serum order book, insufficient funds, timeouts, or other problems.

However, this is not because their WSS endpoint is faster. To gain a top position, we won\u2019t even be using helius.dev\u2019s WSS endpoint; instead, we will only use their staked RPC endpoint, which costs $49 a month with the developer plan. More about that later.</p> <p>Does the above result mean that Helius.dev is superior to QuickNode? Absolutely not. This was just a quick comparison. Staying ahead of the network is not an easy task, and both providers excel at it. In addition to simple WSS and RPC endpoints, QuickNode also offers a wide range of different API endpoints and services for Solana that would definitely be handy for any Solana developer.

Two users are selling their A tokens, but they are not the same individuals who bought in transactions two and three. What might be happening here?</li> </ul> <p>The market is extremely volatile, and this behavior is best described as a game. For ~99% of all fresh tokens, it\u2019s a quick in-and-out process, as these tokens typically crash within 2 to 20 minutes of launch.</p> <p>To understand what\u2019s happening here, you need to be aware of something called pump.fun. The A/SOL token was not originally launched on Raydium \u2014 it was relaunched there. Raydium allows anyone to create a new token, and if a token gains enough traction, it is relaunched on Raydium. This relaunch uses liquidity generated during the pump.fun phase, which occurs when the bonding curve reaches 100%.</p> <p>There\u2019s much more to learn about this process, but for sniping tokens on Raydium, the specifics of pump.fun are not particularly relevant.

Not all accounts are necessary for swapping, but if you want to expand the functionality later, the <code>user_wallet</code> could be important for features like copy trading. The same goes for the standard programs used. I\u2019ve included them here to provide easier flexibility for future development.</p> <p>After that we implement two new functions for our struct get_transaction, and parse,</p> <p><code>get_transaction</code></p> <pre><code>pub async fn get_transaction(tx: Signature, rpc_endpoint: String) -&gt; Result&lt;RaydiumInitialize2Transaction, RaydiumTransactionError&gt; {\n    let client =\n        RpcClient::new_with_commitment(rpc_endpoint, CommitmentConfig::processed());\n\n    let config = RpcTransactionConfig {\n        encoding: Some(UiTransactionEncoding::Binary),\n        commitment: Some(CommitmentConfig::processed()),\n        max_supported_transaction_version: Some(2),\n    };\n    let transaction = client\n        .get_transaction_with_config(&amp;tx, config)\n        .await\n        .map_err(|_| RaydiumTransactionError::NoTransactionFound)?;\n\n    if let Some(versioned_transaction) = transaction.transaction.transaction.decode() {\n        return RaydiumInitialize2Transaction::parse(&amp;versioned_transaction)\n    }\n\n    Err(RaydiumTransactionError::CouldNotParseTransaction)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We use Solana\u2019s <code>RpcClient</code>, specifically the non-blocking version. This is crucial because, later on, we will delve deeper into async behavior to decouple certain processes and distribute them across multiple CPU cores.</p> <p>Next, we create an <code>RpcTransactionConfig</code>, where we request binary encoding and a processed commitment. If we successfully find the transaction, we retrieve it using <code>client.get_transaction_with_config</code>. If the transaction is not found, the function will simply halt and return control back to the WebSocket stream, which will continue looking for new <code>initialize2</code> transactions.</p> <p>Finally, we decode the transaction into a <code>versioned_transaction</code> and pass it to our <code>parse</code> function.</p> <p><code>Parse</code></p> <pre><code>pub fn parse(transaction: &amp;VersionedTransaction) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, RaydiumTransactionError&gt; {\n    let keys = transaction.message.static_account_keys();\n    if keys.len() != 22 {\n        return Err(RaydiumTransactionError::NotEnoughKeys);\n    }\n\n    // Use to debug the order of the keys inputted, if something seems off\n    /* for (index, solana_address) in keys.iter().enumerate() {\n        debug!(\"{}: {}\", index, solana_address);\n    } */\n\n    /* eval token addresses */\n    let base_coin;\n    let token_coin;\n    if keys[13].to_string() == \"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\" {\n        base_coin = pubkey!(\"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\");\n        token_coin = keys[18];\n    } else if keys[18].to_string() == \"So111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\" {\n        base_coin = pubkey!(\"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\");\n        token_coin = keys[13];\n    } else {\n        return Err(RaydiumTransactionError::CantFindTokenAddress);\n    }\n\n    Ok(RaydiumInitialize2Transaction {\n        token_program: keys[12],\n        spl_associated_token_account: keys[16],\n        system_program: keys[11],\n        rent_program: keys[14],\n        amm: keys[2],\n        amm_authority: keys[17],\n        amm_open_orders: keys[3],\n        lp_mint: keys[4],\n        coin_mint: base_coin,\n        pc_mint: token_coin,\n        pool_coin_token_account: keys[5],\n        pool_pc_token_account: keys[6],\n        pool_withdraw_queue: keys[7],\n        amm_target_orders: keys[19],\n        pool_temp_lp: keys[8],\n        serum_program: keys[20],\n        serum_market: keys[21],\n        user_wallet: keys[0],\n        user_token_coin: keys[1],\n        user_token_pc: keys[9],\n        user_lp_token_account: keys[10],\n    })\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We extract the accounts from the transaction and verify that it contains exactly 22 accounts. We also check that an SPL token, such as WSOL, is used. There are different ways to create a token on Raydium, so we perform minimal validation to ensure the input matches the expected format. While more extensive validation could (and probably should) be implemented, every millisecond counts, so we keep it minimal\u2014especially since this is a core route from discovering to sniping a token.Finally we also implement fmt::Display, this is simply to control the output when we print or log our initialize2 struct.</p> <p></p> <p>CLI output of token addresses</p> <p>Create the file utils/src/raydium/mod.rs with the below line</p> <pre><code>pub mod initialize2;\n</code></pre> <p>Add the new module raydium to utils/src/lib.rs</p> <pre><code>pub mod raydium;\n</code></pre> <p>Let\u2019s update the <code>start_thread</code> function in <code>sniper/src/oracle/websocket.rs</code> to use the new transaction parser.
