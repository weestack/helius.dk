<p style="text-align:center;">Hello, and thank you for the interest in me!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I’m Alexander Høgh, a Senior DevOps Engineer.</p>

## Who Am I
I’m a Senior DevOps Engineer with a passion for Rust, Blockchain, and all things tech.
Back in 2024, crypto caught my attention, and I began exploring algorithmic trading and technical analysis. Over a few months, I managed to create several Python algorithms for Freqtrade, implementing:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Harmonic Patterns: Shark, Crab, Butterfly, AB=CD, and AB=0
- Sporadic price channels that follow market trends with support and resistance levels
- Numerous other algorithms

Then... well, you know how hobbies can be—they tend to spiral out of control! I went down the rabbit hole, diving into Web3, Blockchains, Smartcontracts, DApps, and even creating a few memecoin snipers.

Recently, I completed a Solana sniper project, where I set up an RPC node on a Latitude.sh server with Shredstream, Yellowstone gRPC, and Prometheus.

Now, I’m eager to contribute more. If you’ve scrolled through my GitHub contributions, you might be disappointed—most of my work has been closed-source for clients. I aim to change that in 2025 and make meaningful contributions to Open Source.

- An Open Source Solana Sniper in Rust
- All of my algorithmic trading code
- A Limit Order Book smart contract for Solana
- A functional Rust trader for on-chain use

I’ve already started with the Solana Sniper and will release everything in chunks, ensuring the code is clean, user-friendly, and well-documented with blog posts explaining every step.

## DevOps
My Linux journey began at 15, and it’s been a cornerstone of my career ever since. Over the years, I’ve built expertise in:

- Docker and Docker Compose, Kubernetes
- AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean
- System hardening, monitoring, and cluster setups
- Provisioning, backups, and security

Today, as a Senior DevOps Engineer, my responsibilities include:

- Managing 100+ dedicated servers and numerous cloud instances
- Provisioning, monitoring, backups, and security
- Acting as tech lead for a multi-million-dollar eCommerce project
- Mentoring two mentees
- Sparring with seven development teams

## Ecommerce
I’ve been a developer in the eCommerce business for almost 10 years, starting with smaller brands and now working with multi-million-dollar brands.

One of my recent projects involved modernizing a completely non-digitalized industry. This client relied on products from over 50 suppliers, each providing non-standardized Excel sheets with no fixed reference points, no product number, different product names. Together, we tackled the challenge by:
- Matching Excel data with existing products læeveraging Elasticsearch’s fuzzy finder and n-grams
- Creating product variants
- Implementing dropshipping logic
- Adding a touch of magic :rabbit:

## Background
I spun up my first Linux server at 15 and quickly became a "script kiddie," making mods for games like Modern Warfare 2. Those zombie mods were fun... until Steam VAC banned me across all my Valve games :smirk:.

In 2014, I got serious about development. I created a time check-in system for my employer, who had ~120 employees. Each month, his wife received non-standardized Excel sheets of working hours. I taught myself PHP and MySQL, developing a system that standardized the data in just two months—all while working 55 hours a week in a different role. That project confirmed my passion for development, problem-solving, and daily challenges.

Since then, I’ve freelanced for over 30 regular clients across Denmark, Norway, and the USA.
